## Controlling the Car through Wi-Fi

This project allows you to control a remote control car using Wi-Fi. The car is equipped with a microcontroller that connects to a Wi-Fi network. You can send commands to the car from a web interface or a mobile app, which communicates with the microcontroller over the Wi-Fi network.

### Components

1. **Microcontroller**: This is the brain of the car. It receives commands over Wi-Fi and controls the motors and other components.
2. **Wi-Fi Module**: This module allows the microcontroller to connect to a Wi-Fi network.
3. **Motors**: These are used to drive the wheels of the car.
4. **Motor Driver**: This component interfaces between the microcontroller and the motors, allowing the microcontroller to control the speed and direction of the motors.
5. **Power Supply**: This provides power to the microcontroller, Wi-Fi module, and motors.

### How It Works

1. **Connect to Wi-Fi**: The microcontroller connects to a predefined Wi-Fi network.
2. **Send Commands**: You can send commands to the microcontroller from a web interface or a mobile app. These commands could include instructions to move forward, backward, turn left, or turn right.
3. **Process Commands**: The microcontroller receives the commands and processes them to control the motors accordingly.
4. **Control the Car**: Based on the commands, the microcontroller adjusts the speed and direction of the motors, allowing you to control the car remotely.
