# Downloading Arduino CLI using cURL

To download and install the Arduino CLI using the command line, you can use the following `curl` command. This command fetches the installation script from the Arduino GitHub repository and executes it.

## Steps

1. **Open your terminal**: Depending on your operating system, open your terminal or command prompt, 
must be a bash terminal if your terminal is windows.

2. **Run the cURL command**: Copy and paste the following command into your terminal and press Enter.

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/arduino-cli/master/install.sh | sh
    ```

    - `curl -fsSL`: This part of the command uses `curl` to fetch the script. The options used are:
        - `-f`: Fail silently on server errors.
        - `-s`: Silent mode. It makes `curl` operate in a more silent way.
        - `-S`: When used with `-s`, it makes `curl` show an error message if it fails.
        - `-L`: Follow redirects.

    - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/arduino-cli/master/install.sh`: This is the URL of the installation script.

    - `| sh`: This pipes the downloaded script to the `sh` command, which executes it.

3. **Wait for the installation to complete**: The script will download and install the Arduino CLI. Follow any prompts that appear.

4. **Verify the installation**: After the installation is complete, you can verify it by running:

    ```sh
    arduino-cli version
    ```

    This should display the version of the Arduino CLI that was installed.
